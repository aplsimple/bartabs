The *bartabs* should provide a bar widget containing tabs that are

    1) selectable
    2) scrollable
    3) markable
    4) moveable
    5) closeable
    6) configureable
    7) extendable & contractable
    8) enhanceable with popup menu functions

The features #4 and #8 are still in dreams. Nothing to say about docs:)
